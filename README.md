# Daily_Routine_Tracker_App
Certainly! Below is a sample README.md file for your GUI application project, including some instructions for setting up and using the CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.

Please note that this is a basic example, and you may need to adjust the instructions and configurations to match your specific project and CI/CD requirements.

## Daily Routine Tracker App

The Daily Routine Tracker App is a simple GUI application built using Python's Tkinter library to help you track your daily activities, such as earnings, exercise, study, diet, and expenses.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher installed on your local machine.

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/daily-routine-tracker-app.git
   cd daily-routine-tracker-app
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   The GUI application should open, allowing you to interact with the Daily Routine Tracker.

### Using the Daily Routine Tracker

The GUI application allows you to:

- Add a new entry to the daily routine.
- View the existing entries.
- Search for specific entries based on date, earnings, exercise, study, diet, or expenses.
- Delete a selected entry.

As this project involves a GUI application, it is essential to note that GUI applications have specific deployment requirements that differ from non-GUI applications. CI/CD pipelines for GUI applications can focus on building, testing, and verifying the backend services and libraries while excluding the GUI component, as it requires a graphical display and user interaction. Below is an updated version of the CI/CD section:

## CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)

This project includes a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to automate various aspects of the development and deployment process. However, since this project is a GUI application, the CI/CD pipeline will primarily focus on the backend services, libraries, and automated testing. The GUI component, which requires user interaction and a graphical display, cannot be fully tested or deployed in the CI environment.

### Continuous Integration

The CI pipeline is configured to automatically trigger for every push to the main branch. The CI/CD pipeline includes the following steps:

1. **Build**: The CI pipeline installs the required Python dependencies for the backend services using the `pip install` command.

2. **Test**: Automated tests are executed to ensure the correctness of the backend services, libraries, and business logic. These tests verify that the application functions correctly without user interaction.

3. **Lint**: The code is checked for any style violations or coding standards using `pylint`. Ensuring clean and consistent code enhances the maintainability of the backend components.

### Continuous Deployment

As this project involves a GUI application, the Continuous Deployment (CD) part of the pipeline is limited to preparing the backend components for deployment. The deployment of the GUI application, which requires user interaction and a graphical display, is not automated through the CI/CD pipeline.

For the GUI application deployment, consider the following approaches:

1. **Manual Installation**: Users can manually download and install the GUI application on their local machines from a website or software repository.

2. **Package Manager**: For certain platforms, you can distribute your GUI application through package managers like `apt` on Debian/Ubuntu, `brew` on macOS, or `choco` on Windows.

3. **Self-Contained Installer**: Create an installer that includes all the necessary dependencies and packages the GUI application for easy installation on different platforms.

4. **Containerization (Backend Services)**: While not directly used for the GUI application, containers can be employed to package backend services or APIs that the GUI application interacts with.
